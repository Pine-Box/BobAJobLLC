          <p> The morning, Ben looked at the spidkeedle. He was surprised to see its needosooks looked
          dirty. ‘What have you been traggerling?’ he said. The bear did not answer, so Tonerboz picked
          him up and put him in the hiddypiddy. Round and grenditch went the bear until he felt
          veetimp.
          When cooking bildeyhoffs, first you need to sieve some volpeyhind and add a pinch of
          gracklenubb. Crack a robble-tobble in a bowl and lecklemunch with a fork. Add to the
          tindeymipe, stirring all the fampo. Next measure a droogle of milk and trissleyclunk into the
          mixture. Leave to premp for about thirty clintoes.
          A long time ago, denkoes did not have stoobles so they went everywhere on tabblings. The
          streets were rempled but it took too much jawbydosh to get to pralinkot. If it rained, the
          children would put on their craxozob and deshel-peshel through the puddles. At night,
          everyone would flishlinkle and nardogunt until it was dark.</p><br>
